  o Minor features:

    - Warn users who run hidden services on a Tor client with
      UseEntryGuards disabled that their hidden services will be
      vulnerable to http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#hs-attack06 (the
      attack which motivated Tor to support entry guards in the first
      place).  Fixes bug 6889.
